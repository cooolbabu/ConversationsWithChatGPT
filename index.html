          Generative AI is both terrifying and incredible, revolutionizing every
          profession. As a Machine Learning engineer, I embarked on a personal
          quest to witness its capabilities firsthand. Enrolled in an intensive
          data science bootcamp(at MIT-Great Learning), I honed my skills in
          Python and ML techniques. Seeking uncharted territory, I stumbled upon
          Sentiment Analysis on NPR. Join me as we explore the untapped
          potential of Generative AI in this exciting journey

          You are a data scientist performing Sentiment analysis. I have a
          customer satisfaction problem. I want to know, why customers are
          dissatisfied with my products in the Computers category. You need to
          read comments and tell me if .. 1) Product is high priced 2) Issue
          with product quality 3) unhappy with delivery. What deep learning
          algorithm should I use to solve this problem

        <h3>ChatGPT <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></h3>
        <p>
          For the customer satisfaction problem in the Computers category, where
          you want to identify the reasons for customer dissatisfaction based on
          comments, sentiment analysis can be an effective approach.
          Specifically, you can use a deep learning algorithm called a Recurrent
          Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells.
          <br />
          <br />
          LSTM-based RNNs are well-suited for analyzing sequential data, such as
          sentences or comments, because they can capture the dependencies and
          long-term relationships between words. This makes them effective for
          sentiment analysis tasks where the order of words and their context is
          important.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here's a high-level overview of how you can approach this problem
          using an LSTM-based RNN:
          <br />
          <br />
          Data Preparation: Collect a dataset of customer comments specifically
          related to the Computers category. These comments should include
          information about customer dissatisfaction and their reasons.
          <br />
          <br />
          Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the comments by removing
          punctuation, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and
          tokenizing the comments into individual words or using more advanced
          techniques like word embeddings.
          <br />
          <br />
          Labeling: Manually annotate or label the comments based on the three
          categories you mentioned: high-priced products, product quality
          issues, and delivery dissatisfaction. Assign a label to each comment
          indicating the reason for dissatisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          Model Building: Build an LSTM-based RNN model using deep learning
          frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model should take sequences
          of words as input and output a prediction for the reason behind
          customer dissatisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          Training: Split your labeled dataset into training and validation
          sets. Train the LSTM model on the training set, optimizing the model's
          parameters to minimize the prediction errors. Tune hyperparameters
          like learning rate, batch size, and number of LSTM units to achieve
          the best performance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the validation set to assess
          its performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision,
          recall, and F1 score to measure how well the model predicts the
          reasons for customer dissatisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to
          make predictions on new, unseen customer comments. The model will
          classify the comments into one of the three categories: high-priced
          products, product quality issues, or delivery dissatisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          Remember, building an accurate and robust sentiment analysis model
          requires a sufficient amount of labeled training data, careful
          preprocessing, and fine-tuning of the model architecture and
          hyperparameters. Additionally, continuously updating and refining the
          model based on new customer feedback can help improve its performance
          over time.
          <br />
          <br />
          I hope this guidance helps you address the customer satisfaction
          problem in the Computers category. Good luck with your sentiment
          analysis project!

          Ok Then. Let's use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term
          Memory (LSTM) cells. The data is in a file that's in Parquet format.
          It has customer_id, product_id and comments. Give me python machine
          learning code that implement this alogorithm: 1) That finds the best
          parameters to use and then use the best parameters to build a model
